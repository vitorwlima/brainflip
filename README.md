## Todo

### Most Important

- [ ] finish testing the whole lobby and online experience
  - [x] joining through the link has to work (todo: IF your user id is not in the game, you are prompted to insert user name which will trigger the join function)
  - [ ] disconnects
  - [ ] rejoins
  - [x] host can edit settings (have to save who is the host in db) (selects need loading state or at least disabled state clearer)
  - [x] other people can see the game settings but its not cursor pointer and not clickable (verify server-side too maybe?)
  - [ ] host can kick people
  - [x] host can start the game (that component is only the lobby, separate that into its own comp)

### UX/UI

- [ ] after mvp done, adjust cringe copy
- [ ] add sonner for the copy buttons in lobby
- [ ] add smoother animations for the copy buttons (instead of text change, add an icon probably)
